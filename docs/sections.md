# XML Content Structure
The actual CV content is encoded into dedicated XML files, one for each section. The following list reports all the available sections, with the corresponding structure explanation.

- [Education section](sections/education.md)
- [Work experiences section](sections/work.md)
- [Projects section](sections/project.md)
- [Skills section](sections/skill.md)
- [Languages section](sections/language.md)
- [Publications section](sections/publication.md)
- [Privacy section](sections/privacy.md)

Additionally, there is a section ([Personal info section](sections/personal-info.md)) which contains all the contact information about the person to provide inside a CV (e.g., phone number).
